## Your Youtube Addiction

I stopped watching TV. Well, at least I thought so. Like most of my age group I grew up infront of the infinamus screen. Whatever was on, I was on it. And I was not alone - according to... 90% of OECD kids are addicted to the screen.

How much kids are watching Twitch, YouTube Streams.

There are countless evidence to how bad it is for you blablabla.

But like a true addict I thought: "phhh. Addiction? I can stop whenever I want", but I was wrong. Changing old paterns are is really difficult. More about changing paterns...

According to something, you are addict if you're "investing" 50% of your time in your addiction.

So. I thought, lets check it out and I looked into my Google Takeout YouTube files and I was shocked.

Bellow, I present to you, my addiction:


```

```
